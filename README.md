# OptimalPaths_QMTP
This is a code sample detailing the creation of certain figures appearing in Jordan and Siddiqi's recent textbook on Quantum Measurement. 
In particular, these codes execute batch integration and illustration of quantum trajectories conditioned on extremal-probability sequences of continuous readout events. 
The current version (v1, uploaded November 2024) has been debugged in Python 3.9.7, with dependencies on numpy, scipy, and matplotlib.pyplot.

Profs. Andrew Jordan and Irfan Siddiqi recently published a textbook, Quantum Measurement: Theory and Practice (QMTP, Cambridge University Press, 2024).

The codes included herein can be used to reproduce Figs. XX and XX, or variants on them. The current v1 of this code has equations of motion hard-coded for the examples shown there, and in prior published works on the topic. Look for an update soon with added functionality to apply the basic integration tools to a wider range of examples, along with some refinements for speed and ease of use.
